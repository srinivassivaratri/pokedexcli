# Pok√©dex CLI

Bring the Pok√©mon world to your terminal! **Pok√©dex CLI** is a command-line game where you can explore, catch, and interact with Pok√©mon, all from your console.

## üåü Description

Pok√©dex CLI is a terminal-based application that emulates the experience of being a Pok√©mon Trainer. Travel through different locations, encounter wild Pok√©mon, attempt to catch them, and build your own Pok√©dex. The game connects to the real-time [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch accurate data about Pok√©mon and locations.

## ü§î Why?

As a fan of Pok√©mon and minimalist interfaces, I wanted a way to enjoy the Pok√©mon universe without the need for graphics or complex setups. Existing games are great, but they don't offer the lightweight, fast-paced experience that a terminal can provide. So, I built Pok√©dex CLI to bring the excitement of catching and learning about Pok√©mon directly to the command line.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation

Install Pok√©dex CLI using the Go toolchain:

```bash
go install github.com/srinivassivaratri/pokedexcli@latest
```

### Run the Game

```bash
pokedexcli
```

## üìñ Usage

Once you start the game, you'll see the prompt:

```
Pok√©dex >
```

Available commands:

- `help`: Display all available commands.
- `map`: Show the next set of locations you can explore.
- `mapb`: Show the previous set of locations.
- `explore <location_name>`: Explore a specific location to find Pok√©mon.

- `inspect <pokemon_name>`: View detailed information about a caught Pok√©mon.
- `pokedex`: Display all the Pok√©mon you've caught so far.
- `exit`: Exit the game.
